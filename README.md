# Ethereal-Full-Edition
This is Ethereal Full Edition, all of the mods needed, for faster PCs. Minecraft Modpack.

The Ethereal Minecraft Modpack is a modpack that aims to increases performance and quality of life along with some other fun mods such as simple voice chat. 
The Ethereal Basic Edition is a stripped down version of the Ethereal Full Edition for very slow computers, it has the same basic compatabilities of the full edition but does not have some of the larger, but uneeded mods, such as Xaero's Minimap, therefore making it faster.
The Ethereal Full Edition has all the mods that this modpack offers. Most computers can run this.
These to versions of the Ethereal Modpack are built to be compatable with each other, since most of the mods included are client-sided. Only some of the mods are needed for a minecraft server.
